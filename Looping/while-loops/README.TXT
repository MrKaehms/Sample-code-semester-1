PROJECT TITLE: Samples from Semster 1
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: Student Review
VERSION or DATE: 1/31/16
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: run the scenario and look at output, then
                            modify the Example class file as instructed
AUTHORS: Mr. Kaehms
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
// Instructions
+    // In this example while loop we use a variable 
+    // that we call "x" to initialize and update
+    // for each iteration of the while loop.
+    
+    // Our first example will start at x=0, and
+    // execute the code inside the {} until count 
+    // is equal to 4.  
+    
+    // Run the code as is and look at the output. Do
+    // you understand why it prints what it does?
+    
+    // Try rewriting the loop so that the starting 
+    // value is 10 and the ending value is 1 and the
+    // increment is -1.  Do you see the difference?
+
+    // Write a while loop that uses the "isAtEdge" method
+    // to test whether or not the actor is at the edge of the world, 
+    // continues to move the actor until it is at the edge of the world.
