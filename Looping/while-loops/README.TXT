AUTHORS: Mr. Kaehms
USER INSTRUCTIONS:
// Instructions
+    // In this example for loop we use a variable 
+    // that we call "count" to initialize and update
+    // for each iteration of the for loop.
+    
+    // Our first example will start at count=1, and
+    // execute the code inside the {} until count 
+    // is equal to 5.  Our increment in the first
+    // example is +1.
+    
+    // Run the code as is and look at the output. Do
+    // you understand why it prints what it does?
+    
+    // Try rewriting the loop so that the starting 
+    // value is 10 and the ending value is 1 and the
+    // increment is -1.  Do you see the difference?
